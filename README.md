# relative_md_links_file_bug

Small example repository to show that relative links to non-markdown files do not work.

## Relative link to file

This [relative link](json_test.json) should open the `json_test.json` file.

## Relative link to file in folder

This [relative link](src/json_test.json) should open the `json_test.json` file in the `src` folder.
